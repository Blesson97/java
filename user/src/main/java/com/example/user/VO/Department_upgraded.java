The given Java code is written using Lombok annotations, which help to reduce code boilerplate. The current Java version used in the code cannot be determined just by examining the code itself. To upgrade the code to be compatible with Java 17, we can make a few modifications.

Here is the modified code compatible with Java 17:

```java
package com.example.user.VO;

import jakarta.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import jakarta.persistence.Id;

public record Department(@Id @GeneratedValue int did, String dname, String dcode) {
}
```

Changes made in the modified code:
1. The import statements for lombok annotations were removed because they are no longer necessary with the new record feature in Java 17.
2. Instead of using lombok annotations, the code now utilizes the new record feature introduced in Java 14. A record is a type of class that provides an easy and concise way to create immutable value classes.

With the introduction of the record feature, the code no longer requires explicit declarations for constructors, getters, setters, equals, hashCode, and toString methods. These are automatically generated by the compiler based on the record definition.

In the modified code, the `Department` class is defined as a record and contains the three fields `did`, `dname`, and `dcode`. The `@Id` and `@GeneratedValue` annotations are still applicable for use with JPA annotations.

By utilizing the record feature, the code is now more compact and adheres to the best practices introduced in newer Java versions.
